# codename

codename is a basic 2D vector graphics library including the ability to render primitive text.

The following primitives can be drawn via codename:

Line

Rectangle

Circle

Arc

Curve

Text String



Bounds checking is done only on "point" based primitives. Point based primitives can also have their origin changed.

codename is based on and thus requires JHGPixels to work.
